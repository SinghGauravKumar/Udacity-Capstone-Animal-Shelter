    "### Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I utlized my machine learning skills on a publicily available dataset provided as part of a Kaggle Competition. Kaggle is a platform for predictive modelling and analytics competitions on which companies and researchers post their data and statisticians and data miners from all over the world compete to produce the best models. Kaggle also hosts recruiting competitions in which data scientists compete for a chance to interview at leading data science companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The competition I picked is about the outcomes of the animals in Austin Aninam Center. Outcomes represent the status of animals as they leave the Animal Center. The description of the challenge can be found here:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes/data .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As described on Kaggle:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Every year, approximately 7.6 million companion animals end up in US shelters. Many animals are given up as unwanted by their owners, while others are picked up after getting lost or taken out of cruelty situations. Many of these animals find forever families to take them home, but just as many are not so lucky. 2.7 million dogs and cats are euthanized in the US every year.*\n",
    "\n",
    "I found this problem particularly interesting because its about those animals who just can't speak like us, but they do have all the emotions like humans, and the hardships they face in the world. By building a predictive model, I would like to save  those  unlucky dogs and cats who had to be euthanized. From machine learning point of view, the interest lies in the multi-class nature of the problem, which will help me explore the performance of several classification algorithms where there are more than 2 labels."

    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "As we notice in our dataset, there are two animals : cats and dogs, at the Austin Care Center. Some of the animals do have names while others do not. The breeds, sex and colors of these animals are provided too. When these animals leave the shelter, they can face one of the following outcomes : Adoption, Died, Euthanasia, Return_to_owner, Transfer. There has been a log maintained of the outcomes, along with the date and times. The age of the animals upon the outcome is provided too. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the data, for every animal from the Austin Care Center, I would like to predict the probabilities of the animal facing each of the five outcomes, whether they will be lucky to be adopted, returned to owner or transferred, or they get euthanized or die in some other fashion when leaving the shelter. Thus our target variable is OutcomeType. The predictors will be the features of the animals. For example certain breeds are more popular are more likely to be in the lucky set of Outcomes, while certain breeds and certain colors are extremely unpopular. Also, people prefer to adopt young animals like puppies and kittens, however, old animals are ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, I have to establish the feature importances, and if needed create new features too. For example, many animals have no names, but is having a name important? Later, I will show that it is indeed important for animals to have a name. Similarly, instead of having several breed types in our breed predictor, we might want to classify the breeds into pure or mix. I will also notice the significance of the sex of the animals for their outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "After feature selection and extraction procedures, I would employ a bunch of classification algorithms and there performance will be compared against the log-loss metric (to be described in next section). I wish to observe the classification power of those algorithms and thereafter include a voting classifier so as to enhance the prediction by amplifying  the merits of the algorithms involved."
